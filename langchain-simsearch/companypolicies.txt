Welcome to Policy and ProcedurePurpose/Interpretation
The purpose of this Manual is to provide employees of TriageLogic (“TL”) with general information
regarding the policies and procedures of the Company. Nothing in this manual or in any other documents
(such as benefit statements, performance evaluations, or any other written or verbal communications)
should be construed to create an employment agreement/contract (either expressed or implied) for
anything other than at-will employment.
Writing or Revising Policy or Procedure
If you are a TriageLogic employee who is writing or revising a policy or procedure, please consult section
# 2 of this manual: Policy and Procedure Development & Maintenance. The policy outlines the policy
and procedure formatting and organization, and the process for approval of policies and procedures.
About Our Company CORE2c
Today, TriageLogic is a leading provider of quality, affordable triage solutions. We are a physician-led
company that offers leading-edge nurse triage services.
We serve busy practices in need of a phone triage system for patients. Some of our physician groups are
part of a hospital or a health system. We service all locations in the United States. All groups of patients
(e.g., pediatric, adult, geriatric) are covered by TriageLogic.
Triage Logic Nurse Triage on Call provides telephone nurse triage coverage for providers and their
patients. CORE 2b
How it works:
1. Patient calls and talks to a triage representative
2. Nurse calls patient back and directs patient to the appropriate level of care
3. As the nurse handles the call, the system documents all the details and the encounter is sent to the
physician’s office
Key Features:
• Gold Standard Protocols from Schmitt-Thompson
• All calls recorded
• All licensed registered nurses
• Call back average time less than 30 minutes
Mission Statement CORE 2a
Our mission is to continue to lead the field of nurse triage. We commit our expertise, compassion and
reliability to services that exceed expectations of medical professionals and their patients.
“Taking care of our communities one call at a time”

I. POLICY
TriageLogic will maintain a policy and procedure manual online. A new electronic copy of the P/P in its
entirety will be emailed to replace the existing manual should a revision or update occur. The P/P will be
emailed to the managers and the managers are responsible to distribute to necessary staff. The
policy/procedure will be emailed to PRN and other staff as it relates to their job.
TriageLogic (TL) is dedicated to standardizing the way business is conducted among all staff (employed
and contract). When people do things the same way every time, they eventually become able to complete
the process in a shorter amount of time, which means they can do more work in the same amount of time.
Consistency also breeds confidence. Consistent methods assure clients that the company will handle
accounts with the same care and precision during each interaction. Consistency helps employees and
alike know what to expect when faced with a given situation.
TriageLogic has employees in multiple locations and/or employees that work different shifts, staff that
leave the company and new employees will join the company. The easiest way to communicate
expectations and processes to all employees without missing anyone, leaving information out or being
inconsistent is to write and distribute a formal policy and procedure document. Making sure that everyone
has access to the same information assures quality management.
All policies and procedures will be reviewed and approved by the Planning/Strategy/Regulatory
Committee annually, between the months of August and October. This includes all policies and
procedures related to the following: Clinical Policies, Quality, and IT. CORE	3c. Since policies and
procedures can change throughout the year, new policies and procedure revisions can be brought to any
weekly committee for approval and documented in the minutes.
Depending on the change made to the policy/procedure, employee training will take place at individual
monthly meetings. In addition, when the policy is updated, the employee will receive a current copy of
the policy/procedure manual in its entirety and will attest they received it and will comply.
A standardized format for policies and procedures will not be required at TriageLogic as some forms are
better than others for a given process; however, the following are required of every TL policy and
procedure.
